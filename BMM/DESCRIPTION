Description: This package introduced in a model-based clustering framework by utilizing a structure similar to a mixture of factor analyzers. 
    Clustering of variables are introduced by imposing constraints on the entries of the factor loading matrix to be 0 and 1 that results in block diagonal covariance matrices. 
    The latent variable U is assumed to be from a N(0, T) where T is a diagonal matrix. 
    This ensures that the off-diagonal terms in the block matrices within the covariance matrices are non-zero and not restricted to be 1. 
    This leads to a superior model fit on complex data. Details can be found:  <https://doi.org/10.1002/sam.11555>
