\title{Model selections for \code{bmm}}
\usage{
model_selection(df, range_K, range_Q, model, permutation, iter)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame that tries to bicluster. Should only contain numeric values.}

\item{range_K}{All possible number of components. A vector.}

\item{range_Q}{All possible number of bicluster for each component. A vector}

\item{model}{The covaraince structure you choose, there are 16 different models belongs to
this family:UUU, UUG, UUD, UUC, UGU, UGG, UGD, UGC, GUU, GUG, GUD, GUC, GGU, GGG, GGD, GGC. You can
choose more than 1 covarance structure to do model selection.}

\item{permutation}{Only has effect when model contains UUU, UUG, UUD or UUC. If TRUE,
it assume the number of biclusters could be different for different components. If FALSE,
it assume the number of biclusters are the same cross all components. Default is FALSE.}

\item{iter}{Max iterations, defaul is 150.}
}
\value{
A dataframe that contain the cov_str, K, Q, AIC, BIC, ICL values for model. There may
be a lot rows if large K and Q, because of lots of combinations: it is a sum of a geometric
series with multiplier max(Q) from 1 to max(K).
}
\description{
fit several models for bmm along with 3 criteria values: AIC BIC and ICL
}
